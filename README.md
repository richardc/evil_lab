# richardc's lab of evil

This is just a place where I've got some marginal hacks and thought
experiments.  Often I use gists for these things but it can be quite
annoying that gists don't preserve directory structure.

I don't cliam ownership for responsibility for all of the things here, I try
and credit people in initial commits and scattered README.md files, but if you
find some code here that's yours but though lack of crediting appears to be
mine let me know and I'll try and correct it.
